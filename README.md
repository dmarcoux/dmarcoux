# Salut! Hi! Hallo! ğŸ‘‹

I am Dany, a QuÃ©bÃ©cois living in the beautiful city of [Freiburg im Breisgau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiburg_im_Breisgau) in Germany. I speak French ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦, English and German ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª.

For the past 12+ years, I have worked as a **Software / DevOps Engineer**. Beside work, I enjoy hiking, bouldering, playing board games, gardening, and anything related to technology.
